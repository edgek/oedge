This is a test project for a web application that allows users to visualize various option trading strategies. One can enter positions in any configuration and then visualize profitability scenarios in a data grid and chart. Slider and spinner controls allow changing of parameters to see how it affects the outcome of the strategy.

More details will be posted to this README.md.
